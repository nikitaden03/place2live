This project is about countries with the high quality of life.
The analysis is performed based on [numbeo's](https://www.numbeo.com) data.
Additionally, [freedomhouse's](https://freedomhouse.org) score for each country is included.

1. [About Quality of Life Indices](https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/indices_explained.jsp) -

    Quality of Life Index (higher is better) is an estimation of overall quality of life by using an empirical formula which takes into account:
    1. [purchasing power index](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/cpi_explained.jsp) (higher is better)
    2. [safety index](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/indices_explained.jsp) (higher is better)
    3. [health care index](https://www.numbeo.com/health-care/indices_explained.jsp) (higher is better)
    4. [climate index](https://www.numbeo.com/climate/indices_explained.jsp) (higher is better)
    5. [cost of living index](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/cpi_explained.jsp) (lower is better)
    6. [house price to income ratio](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/indicators_explained.jsp) (lower is better)
    7. [traffic commute time index](https://www.numbeo.com/traffic/indices_explained.jsp) (lower is better)
    8. [pollution index](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/indices_explained.jsp) (lower is better)

2. [Freedomhouse](https://freedomhouse.org) aggregate Score (0=Least Free, 100=Most Free)
